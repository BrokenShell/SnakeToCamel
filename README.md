# Labs Data Science Workshop: Test Driven Development 
## Project: Snakes to Camels

### Objective:
- Design a function to transform snake-case names to camel-case names.
- No more than one consecutive underscore will appear in the input.
- Improve the design of our code by designing it from the outside in using TDD.

### Key Topics:
- Test Driven Development
- Unit Tests vs Integration Tests
- Problem-Solving Skills
- DocTest vs Others
- Iterators & Iterator Tools

### TDD Loop
1. Write a failing test
2. Make the test pass in the most simple way possible
3. Refactor your code
4. Repeat as needed
